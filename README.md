# iSH FS Tools

Provides a more complete Linux-like CLI environment on iSH by:

- Adding iSH-specific utilities to `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/sbin`
- Supplying a custom `/etc/inittab` and application launcher to address iSH quirks
- Allowing extensive user configuration (e.g., which apps to install)
- Supporting deployment via Ansible

## Preparation

### iSH Node Setup

This step is required only if deploying directly to the iSH device via Ansible.
If you prepare the filesystem in a chroot environment, you can deploy that filesystem
directly.

#### Installing a Minirootfs on iSH

1. Download a recent Alpine minirootfs image, for example:

   ```sh
   https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/releases/x86/alpine-minirootfs-3.22.1-x86.tar.gz
   ```

2. Transfer the image to the iOS device (via iCloud or similar if downloaded elsewhere).
3. In the iSH app, go to `Settings → Filesystems → Import`, select the minirootfs,
   then choose `Boot From This Filesystem`.

#### Configuring SSH Server on the New Filesystem

Follow instructions here:
`https://github.com/ish-app/ish/wiki/Running-an-SSH-server`

### Deploy Node Setup

Deploy initial configurations using templates:

```sh
cp conf_templates/inventory.ini .
mkdir vars
cp conf_templates/overrides.yml vars/
```

## Configuration Files

- `inventory.ini`
  Required for both remote and chroot-based deployments. For remote deployment,
  add each iSH node under the `[servers]` section using the provided name and IP
  address templates.
  For chroot-based deployment, this file must be present but typically does not require
  modification.
- `vars/overrides.yml` Edit this file to customize deployment parameters.

## Deployment

### Remote Deployment via Deploy Host

Run the deployment script:

```sh
./handle_servers.sh
```

### Old Chroot Deployment

```sh
./tools/reset-virt-fs.sh clear ansible
/opt/AOK/tools/do_chroot.sh /bin/login -f root
```

Then use up arrow:

- 1 for: time /root/ish-fstools/handle_localhost.sh
- 2 for: time /root/ish-fstools/my-ish-fs/handle_localhost.sh
- 3 for both

### Chroot Deployment

Download and unpack the Alpine minirootfs:

```sh
wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/releases/x86/alpine-minirootfs-3.22.1-x86.tar.gz

mkdir chroot-FS
cd chroot-FS
tar xfz ../alpine-minirootfs-3.22.1-x86.tar.gz
cd ..
```

Copy this repository into the chroot environment:

```sh
cp -av ish-fstools chroot-FS/opt
```

#### Running Deployment Inside the Chroot

Execute:

```sh
/opt/ish-fstools/handle_localhost.sh
```

## Notes on `mtr` (My traceroute)

Recent versions of `mtr` (post 0.92) cannot resolve DNS names on iSH.
This repository installs an older version (0.92-a from Alpine 3.10) that supports
hostname resolution via `/etc/hosts` and IP addresses directly.
