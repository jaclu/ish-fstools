#  User overrides - Primarilly intended to override group_vars/defaults.yml
#  variables starting with "ift_"
#
#  Obviously, you can override stuff in group_vars/internals.yml, or any thing else
#  but in that case you are on your own, since only the ift_ variables are
#  thorougly checked at runtime, and if empty, the relevant tasks will be skipped.

ift_alpine_packages:
  - openrc # Needed for: ift_runlevel_runbg, ift_runlevel_sshd
  - openssh-server # Needed for: ift_runlevel_sshd
  - tzdata # Needed for: ift_timezone

#
# These are appended to ift_alpine_packages, to make it simpler to just add packages
# without having to list all the other ones.
# For the moment ift_extra_alpine_packages are NOT appended if you have redefined
# ift_alpine_package here. Why that is I have no clue, but it is the way it is for now.

ift_extra_alpine_packages:
  - bat  # cat(1) clone with wings

# If services are set to runlevel "", they will not be installed / activated.
# If already installed, they will just be disabled.
