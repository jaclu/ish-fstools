#  User overrides - Primarilly intended to override group_vars/defaults.yml
#  variables starting with "ift_"
#
#  Obviously, you can override anything, but in that case you are on your own,
#  since only the ift_ variables are thorougly checked at runtime, and if empty,
#  the relevant tasks will be skipped.
#
#  Template for <repo_root>/vars/override.yml (this is in .gitignore)
#  If present it will be read as the last variables file, thus overriding all other
#  variable definitions.
#

# ift_user_name: "" # defaults to ish, if "" no user account is created
# ift_shell: "" # If unset no shell config is done for either root or ift_user_name
# ift_timezone: "Europe/Amsterdam"

# ift_alpine_packages:
#   # Sample for a minimal install, without these the deploy will fail.
#   # Each lists what options depend on them, if the corresponding option(-s) are
#   # set to "" that package is not needed
#   - openrc # Needed for: ift_runlevel_runbg, ift_runlevel_sshd
#   - openssh-server # Needed for: ift_runlevel_sshd
#   - shadow # Needed for: ift_shell
#   - tzdata # Needed for: ift_timezone

#
# Additional packages
# These are appended to ift_alpine_packages, to make it simpler to just add packages
# without having to list all the default ones.
#

#   - bat  # cat(1) clone with wings
#   #
#   #  General Build env for Alpine iSH
