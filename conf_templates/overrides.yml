#  User overrides - Primarilly intended to override group_vars/defaults.yml
#  variables starting with "ift_"
#
#  Obviously, you can override anything, but in that case you are on your own,
#  since only the ift_ variables are thorougly checked at runtime, and if empty,
#  the relevant tasks will be skipped.
#
#  Template for <repo_root>/vars/override.yml (this is in .gitignore)
#  If present it will be read as the last variables file, thus overriding all other
#  variable definitions.
