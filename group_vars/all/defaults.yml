# User-customizable variables intended to be overridden in vars/overrides.yml
# to fine-tune the deployment. The file vars/overrides.yml is listed in .gitignore,
# so it won't be affected by repository updates.
#
# Variables prefixed with ift_ are intended for user customization.
# Some temporary variables prefixed with _tmp are used internally
# to construct the final ift_ variables.
#

#
#  If unspecified, hostname will not be set
#
#  WARNING: Be aware that this hostname will be set to all hosts,
#           so only use if a single host is deployed!
#
# ift_hostname: NameOfDevice

#
#  Create a user account (will be given no password sudo privs)
#  Be aware that only Alpine supports the /bin/ash shell
#  If a shell is defined root will also use this shell
#
ift_user_name: ish  # set to "" to disable
ift_shell: /bin/ash  # set to "" to disable

#
#  Use tzdata for timezone naming, such as Europe/Amsterdam, America/New_York
#  set to "" if no system timezone should be defined, then UTC will be used
#
ift_timezone: ""

#
#  Runlevel for runbg - service that ensures iSH continues to run in the background
#
ift_runlevel_runbg: default   # set to "" if this service is not wanted
ift_runlevel_sshd: default   # set to "" if this service is not wanted

ift_port_sshd: 2022  # set to "" if port should not be set

ift_pkgs_devel: false # set to true if devel packages should be used
ift_pkgs_man: false  # se to true if man pages for everything installed should be used

#
#  Indicates if mtr-0.92-r0 (From Alpine 3.10) should be used. This was the last
#  version that supports both DNS and IP# (and thus hosts defined in /etc/hosts)
#  If set to true, and mtr was included in ift_alpine_packages it will trigger
#  an error due to incompatible package selection
#
ift_use_old_mtr: true # set to false if not desired

#
#  ift_alpine_packages - defines what Alpine packages will be installed if FS is Alpine
#  some temp variables are first used to define what packages to use.
#
#  If the intent is just add more packages in overrides, they can be listed using
#  the variable ift_extra_alpine_packages, to avoid having to duplicate the entire
#  ift_alpine_packages
#
# Items commented out notation:
#   valid packets, just temporary disabled: # - name
#   common packets, not working on iSH: # name - doesn't work on iSH
