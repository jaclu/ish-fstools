# User-customizable variables intended to be overridden in vars/overrides.yml
# to fine-tune the deployment. The file vars/overrides.yml is listed in .gitignore,
# so it won't be affected by repository updates.
#
# Variables prefixed with ift_ are intended for user customization.
# Some temporary variables prefixed with _tmp are used internally
# to construct the final ift_ variables.
#

#  Create a user account (will be given no password sudo privs)
#  Be aware that only Alpine supports the /bin/ash shell
#  If a shell is defined root will also use this shell

ift_port_sshd: 2022  # set to "" if port should not be set

#
#  ift_alpine_packages - defines what Alpine packages will be installed if FS is Alpine
#  some temp variables are first used to define what packages to use.

#  ift_alpine_packages
#
# NOTICE: put this in vars/overrides.yml
