# wait_for_hosts_to_be_ready: false

#  This disables the wait for the host to be responsive
#  mostly useful for Vagrant nodes just after creation

#  Apps that are needed during deploy, always installed, regardless of

crucial_apps:
  - sudo
  - git
  - rsync
  - bash
  - tar  # busybox tar is just too limited, and often fails for ansible.builtin.unarchive

#
#  I have tried to put the equivalent in ansible.cfg
#  but so far it never took effect. Avoiding host keys is
#  most useful when dealing with vagrant nodes that change
#  often. For iSH node it might not be needed, but since
#  they would normally only be accessed locally, it should
#  most likely not be an issue.
