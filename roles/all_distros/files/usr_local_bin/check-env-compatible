WARNING: If procps is installed on Alpine /usr/bin/uptime will segfault.

This has been solved by soft-linking /usr/bin/uptime to /bin/busybox
So this warning is just informational, and won't be seen again until
procps is updated and potentially installs an incompatible uptime.
At that point this issue will be self corrected again.
