#  Unfortunately the console session starts before the boot process has
#  completed. This means that the console will see the "old" version of
#  /etc/motd, might be mildly confusing if you have just upgraded to a
#  new Alpine release. Something like 1-2 seconds after this is displayed
#  on the console, the file is updated, so for ssh sessions, they will
#  always see the current content. If you are curious you can always do
#  a: cat /etc/motd
#  Otherwise just boot again, then it should have caught up.
