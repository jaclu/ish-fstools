# R-check checks if recovery mode has been selected, if so that action
# is not done, and it is logged as skipped in /var/log/recovery-mode.log
#
# recovery-mode is a feature of ift-launcher, allowing safe recovery if
# something is messed up in the environment

# Allow for console to be setup and ready to log boot up.
# Returns immeditally if console mode is not used

#  Regular iSH doesn't clear /run at startup, so it needs to
#  Clear /run/ to an initial state with no services running
#  This is not needed on iSH-AOK, and for such can be commented out

# If you've configured your hostname to be updated through an iOS Shortcut,
# this ensures that the hostname reflects what the Shortcut provides.
# If you maintain a static hostname in /etc/hosts, this may not be necessary,
# but keeping it enables quick updates in case you decide to switch to
# a hostname fed by the Shortcut in the future.
# For more about this, see: /opt/AOK/Docs/hostname-shortcut.md

#  Update motd (in case iSH has been updated)
#  On iSH we get console before this is executed despite the fact that
#  sysinit actions are supposed to happen before conssole is activated
#  This means first boot after new iSH will show outdated version
#  on boot up

#
#  iSH typically does no cleanup at shutdown, it just suddenly terminates.
#  When starting up openrc in default it often finds state of services as
#  already running thus leaving them as is, ie won't try to start them at all
#  since according to the states openrc finds is that default is already
#  the current runlevel.
#  Workaround is to toggle between runlevels.
#  This leads to services first being stopped and then started, ensuring
#  they start up regardless of logged runstate at startup.
